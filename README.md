# Smart_Parking_System
We built a model which describes how smart car parking system works with automated controls and Sensors

Here we using 4 slots for parking and we installed ir sensor on ecah of those slots to detect wether slot is empty or not and used oled to display the details of slot being empty or not, and also used two ultrasonic sensors which detects the car comming in and going out and based on the information provided by ir sensors regarding slots it decides wether gate has to be open or not if all the three slots are filled then gate wont open for cars
